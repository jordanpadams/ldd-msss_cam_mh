   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Bit pattern (hexadecimal value) at the beginning of the mini-header used to help identify product boundaries for flash fault recovery. For MSL, this is a constant 0xFF00F0CA.

   name                   spacecraft_clock_stop
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The spacecraft_clock_stop is the value of the spacecraft clock at the end of the observation. spacecraft_clock_stop should only be used if there's also a spacecraft_clock_start value.
   nillable               true
   minimum characters     1
   maximum characters     255

   name                   instrument_mode_id
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Specifies the image or video readout mode, which determines the rate the image is read out.

   name                   initial_size
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            Initially-allocated size of data product by the camera (for compressed data, may not match actual size).
